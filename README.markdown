# MacRuby solutions to the exercises in Aaron Hillegass’s “Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X, 3rd edition”

I strived for very idiomatic ruby. This code is 100% Objective-C-isms-free.

* Each exercise has its own branch
* Each commit in the branch is one completed stage in the book
* Each commit message mentions the chapter for the project at that stage
* Each commit message is also annotated with the path to the roughly equivalent Cocoa solution in [Hillegass's tarball][objc-solutions]

This is incomplete. I went up to chapter 9. I don't know when / if I'll do the rest.

In addition to the exercises, a few challenges are done too.

**TL;DR THE GOODS ARE IN THE BRANCHES! IF YOU'RE ON GITHUB JUST USE THE BRANCH MENU AT THE TOP GO TO THE APPS**
